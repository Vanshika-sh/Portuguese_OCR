Hon. Mr. President of EMEM, SA WW

I, the undersigned, Albino Moreira Sousa Guimarães, residing at Rua Agostinho Silva Rocha,
412, 4475-4541 Nogueira, CC carrier 03008462 8 ZYO valid 11/06/22,
TIN: 143718398, Driving License P-237576 4 Validity 08.22.24 Porto

I hereby come to inform you that I am the driver who committed the parking violation
prohibited, I ask that I be forgiven the fine of 30.00 referring to NP 28129.

That day I went to get a medical exam to C. Saúde that I attached, and it was not the moment that
we cross it would not take 2/3 minutes, but unfortunately users now have to wait
outside the premises to be serviced which took a little longer.

I know I made the mistake of parking outside the allowed areas, but considering the time that
unfortunately we all crossed due to the covid-19 that has affected us at all levels,
professional. Family, social and material, and also taking into account the Christmas season
neighbor, she asked once more to forgive me the respective fine.

I look forward to your best attention and generosity.
Best regards

Albino Moreira Sousa Guimarães
